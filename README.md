My name is Chris.
I've worked with data networks for over 17 years, primarily routing, switching and security topologies from installation to design.
I have configured network systems, across many vendors and systems connecting to hundreds of infrastructures.
I'm now learning multiple program languages and apps in order to transition to full-stack development.
